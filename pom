What Is Page Object Model (POM)?
Page Object model is an object design pattern in Selenium.

The Page Object Design Pattern advantages:
Readable: clean separation between test code and page specific code such as locators and methods.

Maintainability  - separate classes are created for different pages of a web application.if there is any change in any 
					element of a website then we only need to make changes in one class, and not in all classes.
					
Reusable – multiple test scripts use the same web elements

Easy project Structure – Its project structure is quite easy and understandable.

PageFactory – PageFactory in the page object model in order to initialize the web element and store elements in the cache.

The annotation @FindBy is used in Pagefactory to identify an element while POM without Pagefactory 
uses the driver.findElement() method to locate an element.

Non POM
driver.findElement(By.name("txtUsername"));

POM

@FindBy(name = "txtUsername")
WebElement userName;

initElements is a static method of PageFactory class which is used to initialize all the web elements located by @FindBy annotation.
